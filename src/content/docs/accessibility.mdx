## Accessilibity

One of the things I hope you noticed is that when we change colors it can get hard to read.

This is due to contrast. Which is the perceived difference in luminance between two colors.

### Color perception is dependent on the surrounding context

> Our contrast, lightness, and color perception is affected by the context of the nearby colors, and other features of a design or image. This makes predicting contrast challenging. It is clearly not as simple as the distance or ratio between two colors.

So we'll be hamstrung if we rely just on math to calculate colors. Instead we need to use a combination of math and human judgement.

### What you should check for?

1. Contast
2. Color vision deficits

#### Contrast

This is most imporant for text.

The WCAG 2.0 standard defines a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 as the minimum for normal text and 3:1 for large text. For optimal reading it should be 7:1 or higher. You can use the [Contrast Checker](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/) to check your contrast and if it meets your use case. [You also can color contrst from your dev tools.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/contrast/)

For other UI elements, they can be below 3:1, especially if there are other deliminating elements such as shadows, borders, or whitespace, but you should still check them.

#### Color vision deficiencies

There are several types of color vision deficits. [You can see your website simulated with various color deficits through the render panel.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-83/#vision-deficiencies) Since some people lack a complete set of cones you should avoid "pure" colors, which can be nearly invisible for some users.

### A more automated approach

Material theme builder uses a more automated approach. It uses a color palette and a set of rules to generate a theme. It uses smart names to make it easy to understand what the color is used for. It also uses a color contrast checker to make sure the colors are accessible.

You can play around with their [theme builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/dynamic)

And if you want to use their functions in your source code
