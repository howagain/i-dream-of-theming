```css
/* This is an example of CSS variables */
:root {
  --css-variable: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* Declare a value */
  color: var(--css-variable); /* Use a value */
}
```

Today, we’ll talk about theming using **CSS variables** (a.k.a CSS custom properties) and how to use them to build beautiful and easy to manage sites.

By the end I hope you’ll have the knowledge of **how to build a dark theme that you can easily toggle on an off** for every app you work on in the future.

## What are CSS variables?

CSS variables are a way to store values in CSS that can be used in other CSS properties.

They are declared with `--` and used with `var()`. They are scoped to the element they are declared on.

```css
/* The root element is the html element or the shadowDOM root*/
:root {
  /* -- is required */
  --blue: #209ffb;
}
```

```css
.button {
  /* var is required */
  background: var(--blue);
}
```

### You can define fallbacks with `var()`.

```css
:root {
  /* if --primary isn't defined it will evaluate everything after the comma, so `var(--secondary, blue)``, Then if --secondary isn't defined it will evaluate white, which is valid and it will use */
  --background: var(--primary, var(--secondary, white));
}
```

_Note: If the first value is undefined it will use everything after the comma of the second. So in `var(--yellow, red, blue)` if `--yellow is undefined, it will return `red, blue`: (See MDN)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var]_

### You can use them anywhere you use CSS

TODO: Put into Codepen

#### In inline styles

```html
<div style="background: var(--blue);"></div>
```

#### In media queries

```css
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  .button {
    --blue: #209ffb;
    background: var(--blue);
  }
}
```

#### In pseudo classes

```css
.button:hover {
  --blue: #209ffb;
  background: var(--blue);
}
```

#### As partial values in compound values

```css
.button {
  --blue: #209ffb;
  background: linear-gradient(var(--blue), #fff);
}
```

#### Even in mathmatical expressions

```css
.button {
  --padding: 10;
  padding: calc(var(--padding) * 2px);
  /* Note that calc(var(--pading)px * 2) would not work as a trailing space is added and (10 px * 2) != (10 * 2px) */
  /* Also padding: var(--padding)px is invalid for the same trailing space reason */
}
```

## Why use CSS variables

- They are **semantic** so you don't have to remember random value.
- They are **easy to change** and can be used to manage global values.
- They are **dynamic** and can be changed with javascript.
- They are **inheritable** and can be used to build a theme.
- They are **scoped** and can be used to build a component.
- They are **responsive** and can be used in media queries.
- They are **pieceing** of the shadowDOM so you can style web components

### The power of CSS made dynamic

While often the neglected child, css is powerful.

Take a look at [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) for an example of what css can do.

With the same html and different css, you can create completely different sites.

But imagine having to change between all of these sites. You'd esentially have to start from scratch each time

So CSS is powerful, but it’s also hard to maintain.

But with CSS variables, we can apply a single class and completely change the look and feel of our site.

## What will we learn?

My goal is that your css will evolve from this:

#### No Variables

```css
button {
  background-color: #1e90ff;
}
```

#### Basic

````css
```css :root {
  --blue: #1e90ff;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--blue);
}
````

#### Intermediate

```css
:root {
  --light-primary: #1e90ff;
  --primary-background: var(--primary, var(--light-primary));
}

.dark {
  --primary: #629aeb;
}

button {
  background: var(--primary-background);
}
```

#### Advanced

```css
:root {
  --primary-hue: 210;
  --primary-saturation: 100%;
  --primary-lightness: 56%;

  --primary-background: hsl(var(--primary-hue), var(--primary-saturation), var(--primary-lightness));

  --primary-text: hsl(var(--primary-hue), var(--primary-saturation), 5%));

  --primary-hover: hsl(
    var(--primary-hue),
    var(--primary-saturation),
    calc(var(--primary-lightness) + 10%)
  );
}

.dark {
	--primary-saturation: 60%;
  --primary-lightness: 70%;
}

button {
  background: var(--primary-background);
	color: var(--primary-text);
}

button:hover {
	background: var(--primary-hover);
}
```

#### Superhero

```svelte
<script>
  const colorVariables = {}

  const generateColorScheme = (hct:string) => {...}

  const checkForAccessibility = (colorArray:string[]) => {...}

  const colorToLCH = (color:string) => {...}

  const colorToHSL = (color:string) => {...}

  const applyColorsToGlobal = (colorObject) => {...}

</script>

<style>
  global(*) {
    --primary-base: 210%, 100%;
    --primary-lightness: 56%;
    --primary-background: hsl(var(--primary-base), var(--primary-lightness));
  }

  .dark {
    --primary-lightness: 70%;
  }

  button {
    background: var(--primary-background);
    color: var(--primary-text);
  }

  button:hover {
    background: var(--primary-hover);
  }
</style>
```

## How are CSS Variables constructed by the browser?

To understand how CSS variables work, their power, and their limitations, it's important that we don't skip over how the CSS you write is actually parsed and interpreted by the browser.

### CSS Object Model (CSSOM)

![CSSOM and the DOM](/CSSOM-and-DOM.avif)
[Constructing the Object Model](https://web.dev/critical-rendering-path-constructing-the-object-model/)

When the browser starts parsing a CSS file, it converts the file into a series of tokens. **These tokens, which include selectors, properties, and values, are then organized into a tree-like structure called the CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**. The CSSOM is a parallel and analogous data structure to the Document Object Model (DOM) and is used to match elements in the DOM with the corresponding styles and apply them to the elements.

### How are properties assigned in the CSSOM?

![CSSOM Tree](/CSSOM-tree.jpeg)
[Converting CSS to the CSSOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CATiyw2-Ns)

TODO: Insert Codepen to show the below especially overwriting css is possible

The CSSOM tree is built by passing down properties from parent nodes to child nodes. These are inherited or computed properties. The browser also checks media queries and will only add a rule set to the CSSOM tree if it applies to the current viewport. Futhermore, it will ignore any rules that are not valid.

Most importantly, **if the browser finds a duplicate selector, it will overwrite the previous rule set with the new one.** This is why CSS is render blocking, because the browser has to wait for the CSSOM to be complete before it can understand how to paint an element. It's also why **CSS variables cannot be evaluated until the CSSOM is complete** and leads to some of the quirks that we'll talk about next.

### How are CSS Variables Evaluated?

CSS variables are inherited by checking up the scope in the CSSOM. Since CSS can be redefined by later rules, **the browser does not know the value of CSS variables them when it is constructing the CSSOM. Therefore, they cannot be used in a way that would cause a recalculation the CSSOM**. Remember invalid rules are ignored by the browser. So if you try to use a CSS variable and it is invalid, the browser will default to it's initial styles.

## CSS Varaible Gotchas

Since variables only have a value after the CSSOM parsing is complete, there are some things that you can't do with them. There is a (proposal)[https://drafts.csswg.org/css-env-1/] to add in `env()` which would be similar to `var()` but not allow redefining the variable. This would allow for some of the use cases that we'll talk about below, but this is still in the draft stage.

### You can’t use them to define a selector

```css
:root {
  --my-property: color;
  --my-value: blue;
}

.my-element {
  /* this will not work, as --my-property is not a valid property */
  var(--my-property): var(--my-value);
}
```

This is because the browser doesn't know the value of the variable until it has parsed the entire CSSOM.

## You can't use them to define a media query

```css
:root {
  --mobile-breakpoint: 642px;
}

@media (max-width: var(--mobile-breakpoint)) {
}
```

[CSS native variables not working in media queries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40722882/css-native-variables-not-working-in-media-queries)

### You can't have a variable defined refrencing itself

```css
:root {
  --my-property: red;
}

button {
  /* This is invalid and would result in the browser using it's default styles */
  --my-property: var(--another-property, var(--my-property));
}
```

While `const myProperty = anotherProperty || myProperty;` is valid in JavaScript, the same pattern is not valid in CSS. Instead, if you wanted this fallback chain, you would want to define it like `--my-property: var(--another-property, red);`


## Naming CSS Variables

The hardest part will be an ever expanding set of variable names.

The first step that you might do with CSS is look at your style sheet and assign obvious values.
For example:

```css
:root {
  --blue: #012F6C;
}
```

However a better naming scheme would hint at the use of the variable for easier theming by other developers. For example:

```css
:root {
  --blue: #012F6C; /* option token */
  --background-color: var(--blue); /* decision token */
}
```

This gives other developers and your future self hints at what the variable should be used for and what will happen if it changes. This will help with accessibility edge cases where we need more granular control (such as red primary with error messages) that we'll talk about more later. Still for more complex values we may want to give them a name too. **So we want to define two levels of colors: one for the color values, the second for their use.** We refer to these as **option tokens** for the values and **decision tokens** for the use. For example if you're defining the text-color use a name like `--button-text-color` then for form elements define `--form-text-color`. This will help you keep your styles consistent and predictable.

## Building a Dark Theme with CSS variables

<p
  class="codepen"
  data-height="300"
  data-default-tab="css,result"
  data-slug-hash="YzjaBvB"
  data-editable="true"
  data-user="howagain"
  style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
>
  <span>

  </span>
</p>
<script
  client:idle
  src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"
></script>

### Defining the Theme
Some key points are to use dark grey rather than pure black, and to desaturate accent colors as they can cause eye strain. For more recommendations, see [Dark Mode Design Guidelines](https://m2.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties).


### Using CSS values to build a dark theme
Now we can build our dark theme by just reassigning the color values for primary.

```css
.dark-theme {
  --black: #000;
  --background-color: var(--black);
}
```

Now by simply applying the `.dark-theme` class to our body, we can change the theme of our site. Writing your styles in this manner limits their side effects and leads to a predicable system.

### Theming with CSS Variables

So far we have been using hex values for our colors. This is fine for simple sites, but for more complex sites we may want to use a color palette. This will allow us to have a consistent color scheme across our site. We can do this by defining a set of colors and then using them in our styles.

This can require computing relative colors, such as a lighter or darker version of a color. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is a color model that can be used for easy relative color calculations with CSS variables. By separating out the hue, satuation, and lightness, we also can independently control our color and our pallette and generate a pallette from a single color.

For example:

```css
/* From astro's doc site */
:root {
  /*
		Variables with --color-base prefix define
		the hue, and saturation values to be used for
		hsla colors.

		Example:
		--color-base-{color}: {hue}, {saturation};
	*/

  --color-base-white: 0, 0%;
  --color-base-black: 240, 100%;
  --color-base-gray: 250, 14%;
  --color-base-orange: 22, 100%;
  --color-base-orange-dark: 22, 72%;

  /*
		Color palettes are made using --color-base 
		variables, along with a lightness value to
		define different variants.
	*/

  --color-gray-5: var(--color-base-gray), 5%;
  --color-gray-10: var(--color-base-gray), 10%;
  --color-gray-20: var(--color-base-gray), 20%;
  --color-gray-30: var(--color-base-gray), 30%;
  --color-gray-40: var(--color-base-gray), 40%;
  --color-gray-50: var(--color-base-gray), 50%;
  --color-gray-60: var(--color-base-gray), 60%;
  --color-gray-70: var(--color-base-gray), 70%;
  --color-gray-80: var(--color-base-gray), 80%;
  --color-gray-90: var(--color-base-gray), 90%;
  --color-gray-95: var(--color-base-gray), 95%;

  --color-orange: var(--color-base-orange), 50%;
}

:root {
  color-scheme: light;
  --theme-accent: hsla(var(--color-orange), 1);
  --theme-accent-secondary: hsl(324, 75%, 38%);
}

:root.theme-dark {
  color-scheme: dark;
  /* We lighten-up the orange in dark mode, to help with contrast. */
  --color-orange: var(--color-base-orange), 60%;
  --theme-bg: hsl(256, 27%, 19%);
  --theme-accent: hsla(var(--color-orange), 1);
}
```

If more control is needed you can also completely sepearte the hsl values and use them directly.

```css
:root {
  --orange-hue: 22;
  --orange-saturation: 100%;
  --orange-lightness: 50%;
  --color-orange: hsl(
    var(--orange-hue),
    var(--orange-saturation),
    var(--orange-lightness)
  );
}
```


While this may seem complicated, we've gained some impressive superpowers. We can theme our whole site from a central location by just tweaking a few variables.

## Using JavaScript to Control CSS Variables

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="css,result" data-slug-hash="PoBewpQ" data-editable="true" data-user="howagain" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/howagain/pen/PoBewpQ">
  Updating CSS Variables with JavaScript</a> by howagain (<a href="https://codepen.io/howagain">@howagain</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script client:idle async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The true superpowers come when you combine CSS and JS together. CSS variables are great at centralized control, JS excels at dynamic control and advanced math. We can use JS to build a theme based on a set of variables. This allows us to build a theme that is accessible and predictable.

### How to access CSS variables in JS

This will work only if the variable is defined on the element itself. Because remember the CSSOM gives elements a calculated style. This however only accesses the literal element's style.

```js
const value = element.style.getPropertyValue("--my-var");
```

So if we define the variables in a seperate stylesheet we need to access the computed style.

If we want to access the computed value of the variable, we can use (`getComputedStyle`)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle]:

```js
const value = getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyValue("--my-var");
```

### How to set CSS variables in JS

We can set CSS variables in JS by using `setProperty`:

```js
element.style.setProperty("--my-var", "red");
```

since we usually define our CSS variables on the root element, we can use `document.documentElement` to access it.

```js
document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--my-var", "red");
```

which would actually create a new inline style that would override the value of the variable, rather than changing the value of the variable itself. But the effect will still be the same due to the higher specificity.

### How to listen for CSS variable changes

So it requires [a bit of a hack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57934680/listen-to-css-variable-change), but it's possible to listen for changes to CSS variables. We can use the `MutationObserver` to listen for changes to the `style` attribute of the element. This will fire whenever a CSS variable is changed. It will not work for a variable defined in a stylesheet. But you could observe a whole inline `<style>` tag with the same method. We also could listen to `getComputedStyle` it has bad pefromance, so it would have to be throttled

```js
// Must be set as an inline style, this would not work if it was defined in a stylesheet
document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--var1", "my value");

// The current value of the variable
let value = "1";

const styleObserver = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  const currentValue = mutations[0].target.style.getPropertyValue("--var1");

  if (currentValue !== value) {
    // the variable has changed
    console.log("style value changed", currentValue);
    value = currentValue;
  }
});

styleObserver.observe(document.documentElement, {
  attributes: true,
  attributeFilter: ["style"],
});
```


## Accessilibity
One of the things I hope you noticed is that when we change colors it can get hard to read. 

This is due to contrast. Which is the perceived difference in luminance between two colors.

### Color perception is dependent on the surrounding context
![Same Color with Two Different Apparent Shades](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_Colors_and_Luminance/yellowdotcheckershadow_dlyon.png)

> Our contrast, lightness, and color perception is affected by the context of the nearby colors, and other features of a design or image. This makes predicting contrast challenging. It is clearly not as simple as the distance or ratio between two colors.

So we'll be hamstrung if we rely just on math to calculate colors. Instead we need to use a combination of math and human judgement. 

### What you should check for?
1. Contast
2. Color vision deficits

#### Contrast
This is most imporant for text. 

The WCAG 2.0 standard defines a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 as the minimum for normal text and 3:1 for large text. For optimal reading it should be 7:1 or higher. You can use the [Contrast Checker](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/) to check your contrast and if it meets your use case. [You also can color contrst from your dev tools.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/contrast/)

For other UI elements, they can be below 3:1, especially if there are other deliminating elements such as shadows, borders, or whitespace, but you should still check them.

#### Color vision deficiencies
There are several types of color vision deficits. [You can see your website simulated with various color deficits through the render panel.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-83/#vision-deficiencies) Since some people lack a complete set of cones you should avoid "pure" colors, which can be nearly invisible for some users. 


### A more automated approach
Material theme builder uses a more automated approach. It uses a color palette and a set of rules to generate a theme. It uses smart names to make it easy to understand what the color is used for. It also uses a color contrast checker to make sure the colors are accessible.

You can play around with their [theme builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/dynamic)

And if you want to use their functions in your source code

## Future of CSS

CSS variables are a powerful tool for building a theme system. They allow us to build a theme that is accessible and predictable. But they are not the end of the story. There are many other features that are coming to CSS that will allow us to build even more powerful themes.

The ideal system would be able to automatically reconcile colors and use

- What about accessibliity?
  - Motion
  - Contrast
  - Giving the user dedicated hints
- I’m building X project, how can I think through my color theme, I don’t need something so fancy
  - Use semantic color variables rather than specific values, allows for easy tweaking later and it’s easy to understand
  - Pick a name system, as always naming things is the hardest part of this
- What naming system would you recommend?
  - Start with the logical types of elements that you have on the page and connect them
  - I’d recommend thinking of the following categories
    - Text (color, font,
    - Forms
    - Interactive elements (buttons)
    - Icons
    - Shadows
    - Borders
    - Radius
    - Neutrals
  - The fewer colors the better
  - I would not necessarily recommend using css variables for spacing/sizing unless there is a special use case calls for it as it can have unintended effects of squishing content, I would instead recommend a 4px grid system.
- I’m using X system, how can I move fast and still build things
  - Not every system is designed to be flexible, but if you can define custom values, use css variables with a fallback color
- How does inheritance work
  - Most specific selector
    - Inline, Id, Class, element
  - Which properties cascade down and which don’t
    - Font/font colors
  - Shadow dom
    - Nothing but css properties pierce the veil
- How do I make a good dark mode?
  - Dark mode is designed to reduce eye strain
  - Pick a neutral shade of grey and reduce the saturation of your colors.
- What alternatives exist for theming?
  - Tailwind has a “dark” mode that you can enable
    - What if you want more than dark mode
  - Passing conditional props to your components
    - Clutters up your logic, especially if you don’t have a solution for prop drilling.
  - Use something like material-UI’s theming system
    - Context provider which a theme prop, but then tying into this requires css in js, which isn’t evil

- Best practices for using CSS variables
  - Use consistent naming conventions for your variables
    - Good naming is one of the hardest part of coding.
      - Easy example, this function is get masked value but what it’s actually doing is taking a number like this and turning It into this. So a more accurate name is convert or usd currency format. Both are accurate but one is helpful for inputs and outputs.
      - Name should give hints about use
      - So rather than #f73424 you could use —primary-background-color
      - The question to ask yourself is “how will someone who doesn’t understand this use this variable?”
      - So in this diagram, if I have black, I actually might want to break that into two separate colors based on use, maybe one for text color and one for shadow color, even if they’re the same. Because variables are evaluated at runtime you can also create variables for base colors if you want to keep your code even more dry

# I Dream of Theming

Ever night millions of people around the world blind themselves when they visit a website without a dark theme. But you can help by learning how to use css custom properties to build easy to manage themes. In doing so you can save not only your customers corneas but also the planet.

In the past, if you wanted to do a dark theme, you'd have to go into every element of your website, open a color picker, and tweak it until it looked how you wanted it to.

The ideal of this would be a simple toggle switch that just says “oh this is your light color site” and here's the dark one.

Sites have added that today but how can they accomplish this. Well here are the docs for Astro, notice their toggle switch. How does it work?

Their source code looks like this?

With one class at the top level they can influence all of the colors. More than that if you look at how they do it, they change these special properties, called css properties.

# So how do I use them?

Within 1 selector

have to be declared inside a selector, usual root or html so they are global

Inheritance

- CSSOM

You might start like this (css evolution 1)

But I’ll let you know that this is okay to avoid magic values but we can improve this scheme by following some better naming schemes.

css design system at C1

## what is this?

- a set of design tokens that both have named values corresponding to the magic value colors - option tokens
- It also contains a set of design tokens which are named after their use

Why are these good?

- Because blue and white are great but what happens when you change to dark mode, and your white becomes this magic grey

how do you do it?

- Because css variables require names it’s important to have your names give hints of use rather than value.
- So white becomes background-color
- It also allows you to fix edge cases where your text needs more contrast in a specific theme of your website

So what if you aren’t sure what to name your variable

- better to be more specific than less specific

# what if I want to make a dark theme

- recommend to choose slightly less saturated colors

# what if I want to make my colors relative?

- Calc can be used in combination
- you can do that with HSL easily if you need to stay in pure JS
- Here’s how Astro does it
- But hsl is not perceptually uniform

# how do I know if my theme is accessible?

- color perception depends on context (use image of orange in the shade)
- use contrast rather than hue difference - that’s why hcl is good because luminance is coming soon
- Also avoid “pure colors” as CVDs are due to color vision deficit
  - Good check is to check color contrast of 3:1 for large text and 4.5:1 for small text and at least 7:1 for reading
  - Then check with color vision deficits for the same rules
- I was not able to find an easy rule for all of this, the best tool that I found for generating themes where accessibility is considered is material theme builder

How do I test css variables?

- cypress has support for css variables
- Depending on your unit test framework - vitest with happy dom loads styles but seems like best in headless mode doesn’t, you can try using window.getComputedstyles to help you

What are some of the future things to look out for in theming?
